# Doubly-Linked-List
This homework assignment entailed transforming an existing single linked list program
into a fully functional doubly linked list implementation. A doubly linked list allows
traversal in both forward and backward directions, which necessitates maintaining both
next and previous pointers for each node. Additional improvements include adding
nodes at specific positions (head, tail, or after the current node), deleting nodes (from
the head, tail, or a specific position), debugging by printing all elements, and searching
for a node containing a specific value.
